Machine Learning AI Custom Unity System:

[DO NOT CHANGE ANY NAMES OF OBJECT LOCATED IN THE PACKAGE]

Basics of how to use:

- Use the MLAgent to create a path, making sure that:
	- The track has colliders
	- The track dows not double back on itself

		(These limitations are in place due to a time limit set on the time taken to complete the project)

- The finishing line of the track must be a collider and have the tag Target, for an Example, see MLTrackExample in the Machine Learning folder.

- In the Window tab on unity, open MachineLearning, where the machine learning tools are located.
	(To solve, make sure the "Solve" button is pressed)

- Once a track has been solved, it can be saved to file with the "Save" button

- Once a track has been saved, you are able to use the MLBot to play the saved data, making sure that "Play on Run" in the inspector of the MLBot is ticked.

- Once that is complete the MLBot is ready.
